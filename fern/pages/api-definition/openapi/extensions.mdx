title: OpenAPI extensions for SDKs
description: Learn about Fern's OpenAPI extensions for SDK method names, authentication overrides, global headers, enum descriptions and names, audiences, and more.
---

Fern supports different OpenAPI extensions so that you can generate higher-quality SDKs.

## SDK method names

By default, Fern uses the `tag` and `operationId` fields to generate the SDK method. So an endpoint with a
tag `users` and operationId `users_create` will generate an SDK that reads `client.users.create()`.

To explicitly set the SDK method you can leverage the extensions:

- `x-fern-sdk-group-name` which groups SDK methods together
- `x-fern-sdk-method-name` which is used as the method name in the SDK

The OpenAPI below will generate `client.users.create()`:

```yaml title="openapi.yaml"
paths:
  /users:
    post:
      x-fern-sdk-group-name: users
      x-fern-sdk-method-name: create
```

If you omit the `x-fern-sdk-group-name` extension, then the generated SDK method will live at the root.
For example, the following OpenAPI will generate `client.create_user()`:

```yaml title="openapi.yaml"
paths:
  /users:
    post:
      x-fern-sdk-method-name: create_user
```

If you add more than one `x-fern-sdk-group-name` extension, then the generated SDK will nested group names. The order of the group names is preserved in the generated SDK method.

For example, the following OpenAPI will generate `client.admin.users.create()`:

```yaml title="openapi.yaml"
paths:
  /users:
    post:
      x-fern-sdk-group-name: 
        - admin
        - users
      x-fern-sdk-method-name: create
```

## API version

You can define your API version scheme, such as a `X-API-Version` header. The supported versions and default value are specified like so:

```yaml title="openapi.yaml"
x-fern-version:
  version:
    header: X-API-Version
    default: "2.0.0"
    values:
      - "1.0.0"
      - "2.0.0"
      - "latest"
paths:
  ...
```

## Authentication overrides

For authentication within your SDK, you may want to customize the:
- Names of the parameters a user will populate to provide their credentials
- Any environment variable the SDK can scan for to automatically provide the user's credentials automatically

By default, Fern uses names for authentication parameters like api_key, username and password, etc.
Note that this configuration is optional, and even when provided `name` or `env` may be provided alone, both are not required.

For bearer authentication:

```yaml title="openapi.yaml"
components:
  securitySchemes:
    BearerAuth:
      type: http
      scheme: bearer
      x-fern-bearer:
        name: apiKey
        env: FERN_API_KEY
```

In a Python SDK for example, the above configuration would produce a client that looks like:

```python
import os

class Client:

  def __init__(self, *, apiKey: str = os.getenv("FERN_API_KEY"))
```

Similarly, for basic authentication the configuration is:

```yaml title="openapi.yaml"
components:
  securitySchemes:
    BasicAuth:
      type: http
      scheme: basic
      x-fern-basic:
        username:
          name: clientId
          env: MY_CLIENT_ID
        password:
          name: clientSecret
          env: MY_CLIENT_SECRET
```

And for a custom auth header configuration:

```yaml title="openapi.yaml"
components:
  securitySchemes:
    ApiKeyAuth:
      type: apiKey
      in: header
      name: X-API-Key
      x-fern-header:
        name: header
        env: MY_HEADER_ENVVAR
        prefix: "Token "  # Optional
```

This adds a header of the form `X-API-Key: Token <value>` to the request.

## Global headers

At times, your API will leverage certain headers for every endpoint, or the majority of them, we call these "global headers". For convenience, generated Fern SDKs expose "global headers" to easily be updated on API calls. Take for example an API key, if we declare the API key as a global header, a user will be able to plug theirs in easily:

```python
import os

class Client:

  def __init__(self, *, apiKey: str):
```

To configure global headers, Fern will automatically pull out headers that are used in every request, or the majority of requests, and mark them as global.
In order to label additional headers as global, or to alias the names of global headers, you can leverage the `x-fern-global-headers` extension:

```yaml title="openapi.yml"
x-fern-global-headers:
  - header: custom_api_key
    name: api_key
  - header: userpool_id
    optional: true
```

yields the following client:

```python
import os

class Client:

  def __init__(self, *, apiKey: str, userpoolId: typing.Optional[str])
```

## Enum descriptions and names

OpenAPI doesn't natively support adding descriptions to enum values. To do this in Fern you can use the `x-fern-enum`
extension.

In the example below, we've added some descriptions to enum values. These descriptions will
propagate into the generated SDK and docs website.

```yaml title="openapi.yml" {9-13}
components:
  schemas:
    CardSuit:
      enum:
        - clubs
        - diamonds
        - hearts
        - spades
      x-fern-enum:
        clubs:
          description: Some docs about clubs
        spades:
          description: Some docs about spades
```

`x-fern-enum` also supports a `name` field that allows you to customize the name of the enum in code.
This is particularly useful when you have enums that rely on symbolic characters that would otherwise cause
generated code not to compile.

For example, the following OpenAPI

```yaml title="openapi.yml" {9,12}
components:
  schemas:
    Operand:
      enum:
        - >
        - <
      x-fern-enum:
        >:
          name: GreaterThan
          description: Checks if value is greater than
        <:
          name: LessThan
          description: Checks if value is less than
```

would generate

```typescript title="operand.ts"
export enum Operand {
  GreaterThan = ">",
  LessThan = "<",
}
```

## Schema names

OpenAPI allows you to define inlined schemas that do not have names.

```yaml title="Inline type in openapi.yml" {11}
components:
  schemas:
    Movie:
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        cast:
          type: array
          items:
            type: object
            properties:
              firstName:
                type: string
              lastName:
                type: string
              age:
                type: integer
```

Fern automatically generates names for all the inlined schemas. For example, in this example,
Fern would generate the name `CastItem` for the inlined array item schema.

```typescript title="Auto-generated name" {6}
export interface Movie {
    name?: string;
    cast?: CastItem[]
}

export interface CastItem  {
    firstName?: string;
    lastName?: string;
    age?: integer;
}
```

If you want to override the generated name, you can use the extension `x-fern-type-name`.

```yaml title="openapi.yml" {12}
components:
  schemas:
    Movie:
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        cast:
          type: array
          items:
            type: object
            x-fern-type-name: Person
            properties:
              firstName:
                type: string
              lastName:
                type: string
              age:
                type: integer
```

This would replace `CastItem` with `Person` and the generated code would read more idiomatically:

```typescript title="Overridden name" {6}
export interface Movie {
    name?: string;
    cast?: Person[]
}

export interface Person  {
    firstName?: string;
    lastName?: string;
    age?: integer;
}
```

## Parameter names

The `x-fern-parameter-name` extension allows you to customize the variable name of OpenAPI
parameters.

For example, if you have a header `X-API-Version`, you may want the parameter
in code to be called `version`.

```yaml title="Specify the parameter name in openapi.yml" {8}
paths:
  "/user":
    get:
      operationId: get_user
      parameters:
        - in: header
          name: X-API-Version
          x-fern-parameter-name: version
          schema:
            type: string
          required: true
      ...
```

## Property Names

The `x-fern-property-name` extension allows you to customize the variable name for object 
properties. 

For example, if you had a property called `_metadata` in your schema but you wanted the 
variable to be called `data` in your SDK you would do the following: 

```yaml {6}
components: 
  schemas: 
    MyUser: 
      _metadata: 
        type: object
        x-fern-property-name: data
```

## Server names

The `x-fern-server-name` extension is used to name your servers.

```yaml title="openapi.yml"
servers:
- url: https://api.example.com
  x-fern-server-name: Production
- url: https://sandbox.example.com
  x-fern-server-name: Sandbox
```

In a generated TypeScript SDK, you'd see:

```typescript title="environment.ts"
export const ExampleEnvironment = {
    Production: "https://api.example.com",
} as const;

export type ExampleEnvironment = typeof ExampleEnvironment.Production;
```

## Base path

The `x-fern-base-path` extension is used to configure the base path prepended to every endpoint.

In the example below, we have configured the `/v1` base path so the full endpoint path is
`https://api.example.com/v1/users`.

```yaml title="Set the base path in openapi.yml" {1}
x-fern-base-path: /v1
servers:
- url: https://api.example.com
paths:
  /users:
    ...
```

## Audiences

Audiences are a useful tool for segmenting your API for different consumers. You can configure your Fern Docs to publish documentation specific to an `Audience`. You can use [audiences in your Fern Definition](/learn/api-definition/fern/audiences), too. 

Common examples of audiences include:

- Internal consumers (e.g., frontend developers who use the API)
- Beta testers
- Customers

By default, if no audience is specified, it will be accessible to all consumers. 

### Audiences for Endpoints

To mark an endpoint with a particular audience, add the `x-fern-audiences` extension to the relevant endpoint.

In the example below, the `POST /users/sendEmail` endpoint is only available to internal consumers:

```yaml title="openapi.yml" {4-5}
paths:
  /users/sendEmail:
    post:
      x-fern-audiences:
        - internal
      operationId: send_email
      ...
```

### Audiences for Components 

Components can be marked for different audiences, as well. 

In this example, the `Email` type is available to both internal and beta customers, while the `to` property is available to beta customers only: 
```yaml title="openapi.yml" {13-17}
components: 
  schemas: 
    Email: 
      title: Email
      type: object
      properties: 
        subject:
          type: string
        body: 
          type: string
        to: 
          type: string
          x-fern-audiences: <-- property audience
            - beta
      x-fern-audiences: <-- type audience
        - internal
        - beta
```

### Audiences for SDKs

In `generators.yml`, you can apply audience filters so that only certain
endpoints are passed to the generators. 

The following example configures the SDKs to filter for the `customers` audience:
```yaml title="generators.yml" {3-4}
groups:
  sdks:
    audiences:
      - customers
    generators:
      - name: fernapi/fern-tyepscript-node-sdk
        version: 0.8.8
        ...
```

### Audiences for Docs

If generating Fern Docs, update your `docs.yml` configuration to include your audiences. 

The following example shows how to configure your `docs.yml` to publish documentation for the `customers` audience:

```yaml title="docs.yml" {3-4}
navigation:
  - api: API Reference
    audiences:
      - customers
```

## Streaming

The `x-fern-streaming` extension is used to specify that an endpoint's response is streamed.
Include the `x-fern-streaming` extension within your endpoint like so:

```yaml title="x-fern-streaming in openapi.yml" {4}
paths:
  /logs:
    post:
      x-fern-streaming: true
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                topic:
                  description: ""
                  type: string
      responses:
        "200":
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: "#/components/schemas/Log"
components:
  schemas:
    Log:
      type: object
      properties:
        topic:
          type: string
        message:
          type: string
```

If you want to generate both a non-streaming and streaming SDK method variant for the same endpoint,
you can use the extended `x-fern-streaming` syntax:

```yaml title="Extended x-fern-streaming syntax in openapi.yml" {4-9}
paths:
  /logs:
    post:
      x-fern-streaming:
        stream-condition: $request.stream
        response:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/Logs"
        response-stream:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/Log"
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                topic:
                  description: ""
                  type: string
      responses:
        "200":
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: "#/components/schemas/Log"
components:
  schemas:
    Log:
      type: object
      properties:
        topic:
          type: string
        message:
          type: string
    Logs:
      type: array
      items:
        - $ref: "#/components/schemas/Log"
```

The same endpoint path (`/logs` in the example above) is used for both of the generated SDK methods,
and the `stream-condition` setting includes a property in the request body that is used to
distinguish whether the response should be streamed.

In the example above, a property named `stream` is sent as `true` for the streaming variant,
and sent as `false` for the non-streaming variant. Additionally, a stream of the `Log` type
is returned in the streaming variant, whereas the `Logs` array is returned in the non-streaming
variant.

## Ignoring schemas or endpoints

If you want Fern to skip reading any endpoints or schemas, use the `x-fern-ignore` extension.

To skip an endpoint, add `x-fern-ignore: true` at the operation level.

```yaml title="x-fern-ignore at operation level in openapi.yml" {4}
paths:
  /users:
    get:
      x-fern-ignore: true
      ...
```

To skip a schema, add `x-fern-ignore: true` at the schema level.

```yaml title="x-fern-ignore at schema level in openapi.yml" {4}
components:
  schemas:
    SchemaToSkip:
      x-fern-ignore: true 
      ...
```

## Overlaying extensions

Because of the number of tools that use OpenAPI, it may be more convenient to
"overlay" your fern specific OpenAPI extensions onto your original definition. \
In order to do this you can specify your overrides file in `generators.yml`.

Below is an example of how someone can overlay the extensions `x-fern-sdk-method-name` and
`x-fern-sdk-group-name` without polluting their original OpenAPI. The combined result is
shown in the third tab.

<CodeBlocks>
    ```yaml title="generators.yml" {3}
    api:
      path: ./openapi/openapi.yaml
      overrides: ./openapi/overrides.yaml
    default-group: sdk
    groups:
      sdk:
        generators:
          - name: fernapi/fern-python-sdk
            version: 2.2.0
    ```

    ```yaml title="overrides.yml"
    paths:
      /users:
        get:
          x-fern-sdk-group-name: users
          x-fern-sdk-method-name: get
    ```

    ```yaml title="Overlayed OpenAPI" {4-5}
    paths:
      /users:
        get:
          x-fern-sdk-group-name: users
          x-fern-sdk-method-name: get
          summary: Get a list of users
          description: Retrieve a list of users from the system.
          responses:
            '200':
              description: Successful response
            '500':
              description: Internal Server Error
    ```
</CodeBlocks>

## Embedding extensions

If instead of overlaying your extensions within an overrides file, as mentioned above. Certain frameworks that generate OpenAPI specs make it easy to embed extensions directly from code.

### FastAPI

Please view our page on [FastAPI](/learn/api-definition/openapi/frameworks/fastapi) for more information on how to extend your OpenAPI spec within FastAPI.

## Request + response examples

While OpenAPI has several fields for examples, there is no easy way
to associate a request with a response. This is especially useful when
you want to show more than one example in your documentation.

`x-fern-examples` is an array of examples. Each element of the array
can contain `path-parameters`, `query-parameters`, `request` and `response`
examples values that are all associated.

```yaml title="openapi.yml" {5-16}
paths:
  /users/{userId}:
    get:
      x-fern-examples:
        - path-parameters:
            userId: user-1234
          response:
            body:
              name: Foo
              ssn: 1234
        - path-parameters: 
            userId: user-4567
          response:
            body:
              name: Foo
              ssn: 4567
components:
  schemas:
    User:
      type: object
      properties:
        name:
          type: string
        ssn:
          type: integer
```

### Code samples

If you'd like to specify custom code samples for your example, use `code-samples`.

```yaml title="openapi.yml" {11-16}
paths:
  /users/{userId}:
    get:
      x-fern-examples:
        - path-parameters:
            userId: user-1234
          response:
            body:
              name: Foo
              ssn: 1234
          code-samples:
            - sdk: typescript
              code: |
                import { UserClient } from "...";

                client.users.get("user-1234")
```

If you're on the Fern Starter plan or higher for SDKs you won't have to worry about manually adding code samples! Our generators do that for you.

## Availability

The `x-fern-availability` extension is used to mark the availability of an endpoint. The availability information propagates into the generated Fern Docs website as visual tags.

The options are:
- `beta`
- `generally-available`
- `deprecated`

The example below marks that the `POST /pet` endpoint is `deprecated`.

```yaml title="x-fern-availability in openapi.yml" {4}
paths:
  /pet:
    post:
      x-fern-availability: deprecated
```

This renders as:

![Screenshot of API Reference endpoint with tag showing deprecated](https://fern-image-hosting.s3.amazonaws.com/fern/x-fern-availability-example.png)

### Request new extensions

If there's an extension you want that doesn't already exist, file an [issue](https://github.com/fern-api/fern/issues/new) to start a discussion about it.
