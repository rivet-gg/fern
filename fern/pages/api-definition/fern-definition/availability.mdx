title: Availability in Fern Definition 
description: Add availability to Fern Definition API services, endpoints, types, or properties to indicate their release status.
---

You can add `availability` to an endpoint, type, or property within your Fern Definition.

Availability can be:
- `in-development` which means it is being worked on; will show a `Beta` tag
- `pre-release` which means it is available; will show a `Beta` tag
- `deprecated` which means it will be removed in the future; will show a `Deprecated` tag
- `generally-available` which means it is stable and available for use; will show a `GA` tag

## Endpoint 

<CodeBlock title="pet.yml">
```diff
service:
  base-path: /pet
  auth: true
  endpoints:
    add:
+     availability: deprecated
      display-name: Add pet

      method: POST
      path: ""
      request: AddPetRequest
      response: Pet
```
