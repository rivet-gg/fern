title: Examples in Fern Definition 
subtitle: Use Fern Definition to add API examples that are shown in comments of SDKs, API reference documentation, and a Postman collection.
---

You can add examples for types and endpoints. Examples are shown as
comments in your SDKs, in the request & response of your documentation,
and in a Postman Collection.

## Validation

The Fern CLI validates that your examples match the expected types. The following won't compile:

```yaml
types:
  UserId:
    type: integer
    examples:
      - value: hello # not an integer
```

```bash CLI Error Message
[api]: example.yml -> types -> UserId -> examples[0]
       Expected example to be an integer. Example is: "hello"
```

## Referencing examples

You can reference an example from another type, endpoint, or error.

Just like types, you can compose examples. To reference an example from another
type, use `$`.

```yaml
types:
  UserId:
    type: integer
    examples:
      - name: Example1
        value: user-id-123

  User:
    properties:
      id: UserId
      name: string
    examples:
      - value:
          id: $UserId.Example1 # <---
          name: Jane Smith
```

## Examples for types

### Objects

```yml
types:
  ShipTo:
    properties:
      street1: string
      street2: optional<string>
      city: string
      state: string
      postalCode: string
      country: Country
      isResidential: boolean
    examples:
      - name: WhiteHouse
        value:
          street1: 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
          city: Washington DC
          state: Washington DC
          postalCode: "20500"
          country: US
          isResidential: true
      - name: EmpireStateBuilding
        value:
          street1: 350 5th Ave
          street2:
          city: New York
          state: NY
          postalCode: "10118"
          country: US
          isResidential: false
```

<CodeBlock title = "Generated TypeScript SDK">
```typescript
/**
 * Represents a shipping address.
 * 
 * The White House address
 * @example {
 *  street1: "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW",
 *  city: "Washington DC",
 *  state: "Washington DC",
 *  postalCode: "20500",
 *  country: "US",
 *  isResidential: true
 * }
 * 
 * * The Empire State Building address
 * @example {
 *  street1: "350 5th Ave",
 *  city: "New York",
 *  state: "NY",
 *  postalCode: "10118",
 *  country: "US",
 *  isResidential: false
 * }
 */
type ShipTo = {
  street1: string;
  street2?: string;
  city: string;
  state: string;
  postalCode: string;
  country: Country;
  isResidential: boolean;
};
```
</CodeBlock>

### Lists

```yml
 Shipments:
    type: list<ShipmentStatus>
    examples:
      - name: Default
        value:
          - status: "InTransit"
            estimatedDeliveryDate: "2024-01-11"
          - status: "Delivered"
            estimatedDeliveryDate: "2024-01-13"
```

### Unions

#### Discriminated Union

```yml
types:
  Animal:
    union:
      dog: Dog
      cat: Cat
    examples:
      - value:
          type: dog
          likesToWoof: true
  Dog:
    properties:
      likesToWoof: boolean
  Cat:
    properties:
      likesToMeow: boolean
```

<CodeBlock title = "Generated TypeScript SDK">
```typescript
/**
 * Represents an animal, which can be either a Dog or a Cat.
 *
 * Example of a Dog:
 * @example {
 *  type: "dog",
 *  likesToWoof: true
 * }
 */
type Animal = Dog | Cat;
```
</CodeBlock>

#### Undiscriminated Union

```yml
types:
  Animal:
    discriminated: false
    union:
      - Dog
      - Cat
    examples:
      - value:
          likesToMeow: true
  Dog:
    properties:
      likesToWoof: boolean
  Cat:
    properties:
      likesToMeow: boolean
```

<CodeBlock title = "Generated TypeScript SDK">
```typescript
/**
 * Represents an Animal, which can be either a Dog or a Cat.
 *
 * Example of an Animal as a Cat:
 * @example {
 *  likesToMeow: true
 * }
 */
type Animal = Dog | Cat;
```
</CodeBlock>

### Aliases

```yml
types:
  UserId:
    docs: A unique identifier for a user
    type: string
    examples:
      - value: user-id-123
```

<CodeBlock title="Generated TypeScript SDK">
  ```typescript 
  /** 
  * A unique identifier for a user * 
  * @example "user-id-123" 
  */ 
  type UserId = string; 
  ```
</CodeBlock>

## Examples for endpoints

You can add examples of successful and error responses for your endpoints. 
Examples can reference the examples of types to avoid duplication.

```yml

  auth: true
  base-path: ""
  endpoints:
    CreateShippingLabel:
      docs: Create a new shipping label.
