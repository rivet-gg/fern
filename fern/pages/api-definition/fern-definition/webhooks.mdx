In Fern, you can specify webhooks in your API definition. The webhooks will be included 
in both the generated SDKs and the API documentation.

## Webhook definition

Each webhook defines:

1. **Method**: The HTTP Method that the webhook will use (either `GET` or `POST`)
2. **Headers**: The headers that the webhook will send
3. **Payload**: The schema of the webhook payload

      method: POST 
      headers:
