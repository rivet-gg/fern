title: The api.yml configuration file
description: The api.yml file contains general API configuration when using the Fern Definition format.
---

A `fern/` folder has a special file called `api.yml`, which includes all the API-wide configuration.

```yaml
fern/
├─ fern.config.json
├─ generators.yml
└─ definition/
  ├─ api.yml # <---
  ├─ pet.yml
  ├─ store.yml
  └─ user.yml
```

## API name

This name is used to uniquely identify your API in your organization. If you just have one API, then `api` is a sufficient name.

<CodeBlock title="api.yml">
```yaml
name: api
```
</CodeBlock>

## API description

You can define a top level API description. This description will come through in the OpenAPI spec and Postman collection.

<CodeBlock title="api.yml">
```yaml
name: api
docs: |  # <---
  ## Header
  This API provides access to...
```
</CodeBlock>

## API version

You can define your API version scheme, such as a `X-API-Version` header. The supported versions and default value are specified like so:

<CodeBlock title="api.yml">
```yaml
version:
  header: X-API-Version
  default: "2.0.0"
  values:
    - "1.0.0"
    - "2.0.0"
    - "latest"
```
</CodeBlock>

## Authentication

You can specify the authentication scheme used by your API.

Out of the box, Fern supports `Bearer` and `Basic` authentication schemes.

<CodeBlock title="api.yml">
```yaml
name: api
auth: bearer
```
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock title="api.yml">
```yaml
name: api
auth: basic
```
</CodeBlock>

You can also create your own authentication schemes.

<CodeBlock title="api.yml">
```yaml
name: api
auth: MyAuthScheme
auth-schemes:
  MyAuthScheme:
    header: X-API-Key
    type: string
```
</CodeBlock>

And additionally customize the naming conventions used for standard frameworks such as `Basic`:

<CodeBlock title="api.yml">
```yaml
name: api
auth: Basic                  # The name here must match the name of the auth-scheme defined below.
auth-schemes:
  Basic:                     # The name here must match the name of the auth scheme defined above.
    scheme: basic
    username:
      name: clientId
      env: MY_CLIENT_ID
    password:
      name: clientSecret
      env: MY_CLIENT_SECRET
```
</CodeBlock>

and `Bearer`:

<CodeBlock title="api.yml">
```yaml
name: api
auth: Bearer                  # The name here must match the name of the auth-scheme defined below.
auth-schemes:
  Bearer:                     # The name here must match the name of the auth scheme defined above.
    scheme: bearer
    token:
      name: apiKey
      env: MY_API_KEY
```
</CodeBlock>

Custom authentication schemes include custom `OAuth` integrations, too. Simply hook up your OAuth token endpoint and
optionally configure environment variables to read from like so:

<CodeBlock title="api.yml">
```yaml
name: api
imports:
  auth: auth.yml
auth: OAuthScheme
auth-schemes:
  OAuthScheme:
    scheme: oauth
    type: client-credentials
    client-id-env: YOUR_CLIENT_ID
    client-secret-env: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
    get-token:
      endpoint: auth.getToken                # The getToken endpoint defined in the auth.yml must retrieve an access token
      response-properties:
        access-token: $response.access_token # The response property containing the access token. Must start with '$response.'
        expires-in: $response.expires_in     # The response property containing the expiration time. Must start with '$response.'

```
</CodeBlock>

If you need further customization, you can specify the `request-properties` and `response-properties` to bind specific
properties defined on the `request` and `response`:

<CodeBlock title="api.yml">
```yaml
name: api
imports:
  auth: auth.yml
auth: OAuthScheme
auth-schemes:
  OAuthScheme:
    scheme: oauth
    type: client-credentials
    clientIdEnvVar: YOUR_CLIENT_ID
    clientSecretEnvVar: YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
    get-token:
      endpoint: auth.getToken
      request-properties:
        client-id: $request.client_id
        client-secret: $request.client_secret
      response-properties:
        access-token: $response.access_token
        expires-in: $response.expires_in
```
</CodeBlock>

If the `expires-in` property is set, the generated OAuth token provider will automatically refresh the token when it expires.
Otherwise, it's assumed that the access token is valid indefinitely.

With this, all of the OAuth logic happens automatically in the generated SDKs. As long as you configure these settings, your
client will automatcally retrieve an access token and refresh it as needed.

## Global headers

You can specify headers that are meant to be included on every request:

<CodeBlock title="api.yml">
```yaml
name: api
headers:
  X-App-Id: string
```
</CodeBlock>

## Global path parameters

You can specify path parameters that are meant to be included on every request:

<CodeBlock title="api.yml">
```yaml
name: api
path-parameters:
  userId: string
```
</CodeBlock>

## Global query parameters

You cannot yet specify query parameters that are meant to be included on every request.

## Environments

You can specify the environments where your backend is deployed. These are useful
in most generated outputs, like SDKs and in Postman Collections.

<CodeBlock title="api.yml">
```yaml
name: api
environments:
  Production: https://www.yoursite.com
  Staging:
    docs: This staging environment is helpful for testing!
    url: https://www.staging.yoursite.com
```
</CodeBlock>

You can also provide a default environment:

<CodeBlock title="api.yml">
```yaml
name: api
environments:
  Production: https://www.yoursite.com
  Staging:
    docs: This staging environment is helpful for testing!
    url: https://www.staging.yoursite.com
default-environment: Production
```
</CodeBlock>

### Multiple URLs per environment

You can specify multiple URLs per environment. This is helpful if you have a
microservice architecture, and you want a single SDK to interact with multiple
servers.

<CodeBlock title="api.yml">
```yaml
environments:
  Production:
    urls:
      Auth: https://auth.yoursite.com
      Plants: https://plants.yoursite.com
  Staging:
    urls:
      Auth: https://auth.staging.yoursite.com
      Plants: https://plants.staging.yoursite.com
```
</CodeBlock>

If you choose to use this feature, you must specify a `url` for each service you define:

<CodeBlock title="auth.yml">
```yaml
service:
  url: Auth
  base-path: /auth
  ...
```
</CodeBlock>

## Error discrimination strategy

In order to generate SDKs idiomatically, Fern needs to know how to differentiate
between different errors when parsing an endpoint response.

### Discriminate by status code

You can specify Fern to discriminate by status code. This means on each
endpoint, every error that's listed must have a different HTTP status code.

<CodeBlock title="api.yml">
```yaml
name: api
error-discrimination:
  strategy: status-code
```
</CodeBlock>

### Discriminate by error name

You can specify Fern to discriminate by error name. If you select this strategy,
then Fern will assume that every error response has an extra property denoting
the error name.

If you use Fern to generate server-side code, then this option provides
the most flexibility. Otherwise, you'll probably want to use the status code
discrimination strategy.

<CodeBlock title="api.yml">
```yaml
name: api
error-discrimination:
  strategy: property
  property-name: errorName
```
</CodeBlock>

## Global errors

You can import and list errors that will be thrown by every endpoint.

<CodeBlock title="api.yml">
```yaml
imports:
  commons: commons.yml

errors:
  - commons.NotFoundError
  - commons.BadRequestError
```
</CodeBlock>
