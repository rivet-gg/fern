<Accordion title="Local Development">

The Fern CLI supports locally previewing your documentation and hot-reloading as you make changes. Navigate to your `fern` 
folder and run the following command:

```bash
fern docs dev
```

A local preview of your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. 

By default, Fern will pick a port that is available on your computer. If you'd like to customize the port, 
use the `--port` flag: 

```bash
fern docs dev --port 3003
```

<Accordion title="Preview links">

Preview links allow you to preview changes to your documentation in a live deployment. Navigate to your `fern` folder 
and run the following command: 

```bash
fern generate --docs --preview
```

This will output a preview link which you can share with others. 

<Info>
  Preview links live forever so that you can refer back to them whenever you want.
