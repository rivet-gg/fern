title: Configure your site navigation
description: Set up the navigation for your documentation site built with Fern Docs using the docs.yml file, including tabs, sections, pages, versions, and more.
---

## Use docs.yml

Every Fern Docs website has a special configuration file called `docs.yml`. Use this file to configure the navigation for your documentation site.

<CodeBlock title="An example docs.yml">
```yaml
navigation:
  - section: Home
    contents:
      - page: Introduction
        path: ./intro.mdx
      - page: Authentication
        path: ./auth.mdx
  - api: API Reference
navbar-links:
  - type: secondary
    text: Contact support
    url: https://example.com/support
  - type: primary
    text: Login
    url: https://example.com/login
```
</CodeBlock>

## Sections, contents, and pages

The navigation organizes your documentation in the left-side nav bar. You can create sections for grouping related content. Each `section` has a name and a list of `contents`. The sections appear in the left-side nav bar in the order that they are listed in `docs.yml`. 

In `contents`, list your pages with names and corresponding file paths. The supported file types for pages are `.md` or `.mdx`.

A basic navigation configuration with two sections is shown below. The first section is called `Introduction` and contains a single page called `My Page`. The second section is called **API Reference**. This is a special type of section that's automatically generated by Fern, and you do not need to add any pages to it by hand. For more information, see the [Generate API reference](/learn/docs/api-references/generate-api-ref) page.

```yaml Example navigation config
navigation: 
  - section: Introduction
    contents: 
      - page: My Page
        path: ./pages/my-page.mdx
  - api: API Reference
```

If you want to add another page to an existing section, create an `.md` or `.mdx` file. Then in `docs.yml`, create a new `page` in the `contents` list for that section, providing the path to the `.md` or `.mdx` file you created. Example:

```yaml Example navigation config
navigation: 
  - section: Introduction
    contents: 
      - page: My Page
        path: ./pages/my-page.mdx
      - page: Another Page
        path: ./pages/another-page.mdx
  - api: API Reference
```

To add another section, add another `section` to the `navigation`. Example:
```yaml Example navigation config with additional section
navigation: 
  - section: Introduction
    contents: 
      - page: My Page
        path: ./pages/my-page.mdx
  - api: API Reference
  - section: Help Center
    contents: 
      - page: Contact Us
        path: contact-us.mdx
```

## Nested sections
If you'd like a section to toggle into more sections and pages, you can nest sections within sections. Here's an example:
```yaml Example navigation config with nested sections
navigation:
  - tab: guides
    layout:
      - section: Learn
        contents: 
          - section: Key Concepts
            contents: 
              - page: Embeddings
                path: ./docs/pages/embeddings.mdx
              - page: Prompt Engineering
                path: ./docs/pages/prompts.mdx
          - section: Generation
            contents: 
              - page: Command Nightly
                path: ./docs/pages/command.mdx
              - page: Likelihood
                path: ./docs/pages/likelihood.mdx
```

## Sidebar icons

For icons to appear next to sections and pages, add the `icon` key. The value should be a valid [FontAwesome icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons) name.

```yaml Example navigation config with icons
navigation: 
  - section: Home
    icon: fa-regular fa-home
    contents: 
      - page: My Page
        icon: fa-regular fa-file
        path: ./pages/my-page.mdx
  - api: API Reference
    icon: fa-regular fa-puzzle
```

## Navigation bar links

For links that you want to be easily accessible, you can specify a list of links in `navbar-links`. These links appear as buttons in the top right of your documentation website.

```yaml Example of navbar-links config
navbar-links:
  - type: secondary
    text: Contact support
    url: https://example.com/support
  - type: primary
    text: Login
    url: https://example.com/login
```

### navbar-link type

Set the type to either `primary` or `secondary`. Primary links are designed to stand out and indicate that they are clickable with an arrow `>`. You can have one primary link.

### navbar-link text

Set the link text that is displayed to the user.

### navbar-link url

Set the target `url` for the link. 

To use a relative URL, make sure that you use `/` to begin the URL instead of `./`. This link opens in a new browser tab, regardless of whether it is a relative or absolute URL. 

You can use a trackable link in your URL. For example, if using [UTM parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTM_parameters), instead of `https://www.example.com/login`, set the `url` to `https://www.example.com/login?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=navbar`.

## Tabs

Within the navigation, you can add `tabs`. Tabs are used to group sections together. The example below shows tabs for `Help Center`, `API Reference`, and an external link to `Github`. Each tab has a `title` and `icon`. [Browse the icons available](https://fontawesome.com/icons) from FontAwesome.

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
tabs: 
  api: 
    display-name: API Reference
    icon: puzzle
  help:
    display-name: Help Center
    icon: home
  github:
    display-name: GitHub
    icon: brands github
    href: https://github.com/fern-api/fern
    
 navigation: 
  - tab: api
    layout: 
      - section: Introduction
          contents: 
            - page: My Page
                path: my-page.mdx
        - api: API Reference   
  - tab: help
    layout: 
      - section: Help Center
        contents: 
          - page: Contact Us
              path: contact-us.mdx
  - tab: github
```
</CodeBlock>

Here's an example of what the Tabs implementation looks like:

## Versions

If you have multiple versions of your documentation, you can introduce a dropdown version selector by specifying the `versions`.

![A dropdown of the available versions](https://fern-image-hosting.s3.amazonaws.com/versions.png)

When adding an entry to the `versions` list, specify the version's `display-name`, which is visible to users, and `path`, which is a file that must be in a folder called `versions/`:

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml
versions: 
  - display-name: v1.0
      path: v1-0.yml # must be in a `versions` folder
  - display-name: v1.1
      path: v1-1.yml
```
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock title="versions/v1-0.yml">
```yaml
navigation: 
  - section: Introduction
    contents: 
      - page: My Page
        path: my-page.mdx
  - api: API Reference
```
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock title="versions/v1-1.yml">
```yaml
tabs: 
  api: 
    title: API Reference
    icon: puzzle
  help:
    title: Help Center
    icon: home
    
 navigation:
  - tab: api
     contents:
        - section: Introduction
           contents: 
              - page: My Page
                 path: my-page.mdx
        - api: API Reference
   - tab: help
      contents: 
         - section: Help Center
           contents: 
              - page: Contact Us
                 path: contact-us.mdx
```
</CodeBlock>
