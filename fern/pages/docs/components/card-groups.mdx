The `CardGroup` component lets you group multiple `Card` components together. It's most often used to put multiple cards on the same column.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="First Card" icon="circle-1">
    This is the first card.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Second Card" icon="circle-2">
    This is the second card.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Third Card" icon="circle-3">
    This is the third card.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fourth Card" icon="circle-4">
    This is the fourth and final card.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
