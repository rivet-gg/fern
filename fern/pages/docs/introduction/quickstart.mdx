With Fern, you can build beautiful developer documentation that matches your brand. Fern supports writing pages (written in markdown) and generating API Reference documentation (from OpenAPI files).

In this guide, we'll show you how to get started with Fern in under 5 minutes.

<Steps>
  ### Initialize your `fern` folder
    
    All the configuration for your docs lives in the `fern` folder. Inside you'll 
    find a `docs.yml` file that contains all the settings for your documentation.  

  <AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title='Clone the starter repository'>
      Get started by cloning the [starter template](https://github.com/fern-api/docs-starter-openapi). 

      ```bash
      git clone git@github.com:fern-api/docs-starter-openapi.git
      ```

      Next, please update the template settings to use your organization.

      <Warning title="Edit template settings">
        Please edit the details `fern.config.json` and `docs.yml` with your organization 
        name. 

        <CodeBlocks>
          <CodeBlock title="fern.config.json">
          ```json  {2}
          {
            "organization": "{{YOUR_ORGANIZATION}}",
            "version": "0.x.x"
          }
          ```
          </CodeBlock>
          <CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
          ```yml  {2}
          instances:
            - url: {{YOUR_ORGANIZATION}}.docs.buildwithfern.com
          ```
          </CodeBlock>          
        </CodeBlocks>
      </Warning>

      Finally, run `fern generate --docs` to generate your documentation.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title='Use the Fern CLI'>
      If you prefer, you can use our CLI to create a new project. Install the CLI
      by running 

      ```bash
      npm install -g fern-api
      ```

      Then run 

      ```bash
      fern init --docs
      ```

      You will see a new `fern` folder in your project with the following structure:

      ```bash
        fern
        ├─ docs.yml
        └─ fern.config.json
      ```

      Finally, run `fern generate --docs` to generate your documentation.
    </Accordion>
  </AccordionGroup>

  ### Update your docs

  <AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title='Add content'>
      Add content with MDX files. 
  
      ```markdown
      ---
      title: "Page Title"
      description: "Subtitle (optional)" 
      ---

      Hello world! 
      ```

      <Note title="Supported Syntax">
      Fern supports [GitHub flavored markdown (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/) within MDX files, no plugin required. 
      </Note>

      In order for the markdown page to show up, you'll need to reference them from your `docs.yml` file. You 
      can reference the markdown page within a section or as a standalone page.

      ```yml
      navigation: 
        - page: "Hello World"
          path: "pages/hello-world.mdx"
        - section: Overview
          layout:  
            - page: QuickStart
              path: pages/hello-world.mdx
      ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title='Add an API Reference'>
      Add an API reference by adding an OpenAPI spec to your project. 

      ```bash
      fern init --openapi /path/to/openapi.yml
      ```

      This will create an `openapi.yml` file in your project. You can reference this file in your
      `docs.yml` file by adding an api block. 

      ```yml
      navigation: 
        - api: "API Reference"
      ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title='Brand your docs'>
      All of the branding for your docs can be configured in the `docs.yml` file. 

      For example, to set the logos, colors, and fonts for your docs, you can 
      add the following to your `docs.yml` file:

      <CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
      ```yml
      colors:
        accentPrimary:
          dark: "#f0c193"
          light: "#af5f1b"

      logo:
        dark: ./docs/assets/logo-dark-mode.png
        light: ./docs/assets/logo-light-mode.png
        height: 40

      favicon: ./docs/assets/favicon.png
      ```
      </CodeBlock>

    </Accordion>
  </AccordionGroup>
