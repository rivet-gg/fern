## What is Vale?

[Vale](https://vale.sh/) is an open-source tool for linting content from a variety of different file types, including Markdown. 

## Using Vale with MDX

Once installed, you can use Vale with MDX files by adding a `.vale.ini` file to your Fern repo. 

<Tip>
Be sure to add 
```txt
[formats]
mdx = md
```
to your `.vale.ini` configuration so the MDX format is recognized. 
</Tip>

To use Vale's HTML-style comments (`<!-- comment -->`) in an MDX file, wrap within an MDX-styled comment (`{/* comment */}`). For example:
- **disable Vale**: `{/* <!-- vale off --> */}`
- **enable Vale**: `{/* <!-- vale on --> */}`


```markdown title='Example Vale Usage'
Vale will check this text.

{/* <!-- vale off --> */}

Vale won't check this text.

{/* <!-- vale on --> */}

Vale will start checking this text again.
```
