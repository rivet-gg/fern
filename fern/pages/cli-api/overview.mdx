Use the Fern CLI to manage and test your documentation, SDKs, permissions, and API specification from the terminal or via an automated system. 

Check out the [API Reference](/learn/cli-api/api-reference/) to interact with Fern programmatically.

## Installing Fern CLI

Run the following command to download and install Fern CLI from the [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) registry. 

```bash
npm install -g fern-api
```

## Updating Fern CLI

When there is a newer version of Fern CLI available, running any command will trigger an alert. To update Fern, run the same installation command yet again. 

```bash
npm install -g fern-api@latest
```

<Note>
Run `fern upgrade` to update the Fern CLI *and* your project's generators.
</Note>

## Checking the version

Use `--version`, shorthand `-v`, to check the Fern CLI version currently being used. 

```bash
$ fern -v
0.26.10
```

## Authentication and CI/CD

Fern CLI requires authentication before accessing an organizationâ€™s resources. To authenticate manually, login using GitHub using `fern login`. To enable Fern CLI use in CI/CD environments, and for an example showing how to set up Fern and GitHub Actions, check out [`fern token`](/learn/cli-api/cli-reference/commands#fern-token).
