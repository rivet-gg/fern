title: Generate SDK snippets
description: Generate SDK snippets in TypeScript, Python, Go, Ruby, and other languages from examples in your API definition that automatically populate in Fern Docs.
---

Fern allows you to add SDK code snippets to your documentation. This is useful for showing how to use your SDK in different languages. By default, Fern will generate cURL snippets. By following the steps below, you can add code snippets for other languages.

<Callout intent='info'>
  SDK snippets automatically populated in your Fern Docs is a paid feature included
  in the [SDK Starter plan](https://buildwithfern.com/pricing).

## Language support

TypeScript, Python, Go, and Ruby are the SDK code snippet languages supported today. Our development work is driven by customer requests, so please request support for another language by [opening an issue](https://github.com/fern-api/fern/issues/new/choose).

## Configuring SDK Snippets

To configure SDK snippets, you'll need to name your SDKs in `generators.yml` and then reference that name in `docs.yml`. In the following example, We'll use `your-organization` as the package name because it is a common practice. For example, Stripe calls their npm package `stripe` and Twilio calls their PyPI package `twilio`.

### Add examples to your API definition

In order to generate code snippets, Fern needs to read request examples from your API definition. If you're using a Fern Definition, you can follow [these instructions](/learn/api-definition/fern/examples). If you're using an OpenAPI Specification, you can follow [these instructions](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/adding-examples/).

### Define a package name for your SDK(s)

<CodeBlock title="generators.yml">
```yaml
groups:
  production:
    generators:
      - name: fernapi/fern-python-sdk
        version: 2.8.0
        output:
          location: pypi
          token: ${PYPI_TOKEN}
          package-name: your-package-name # <---- add this field
        ...
     - name: fernapi/fern-typescript-node-sdk
        version: 0.20.9
        output:
          location: npm
          token: ${NPM_TOKEN}
          package-name: your-package-name # <---- add this field
     - name: fernapi/fern-ruby-sdk
        version: 0.6.3
        output:
          location: rubygems
          token: ${RUBYGEMS_TOKEN}
          package-name: your-package-name # <---- add this field
     - name: fernapi/fern-go-sdk
        version: 0.22.0
        github:
          repository: your-organization/your-repository # <---- add this field
        ...        
```
</CodeBlock>

### Add the package name to your docs configuration

<CodeBlock title="docs.yml">
```yaml 
navigation:
  - api: API Reference
    snippets:
      python: your-package-name  # <---- needs to match the naming in generators.yml
      typescript: your-package-name
      ruby: your-package-name
      go: https://github.com/your-organization/your-repository # <---- needs the https://github.com/ prefix
```
</CodeBlock>

## Access via API

If you'd like to bring SDK snippets into your own documentation, you can use the [Snippets API](/learn/cli-api/api-reference/snippets/get). API access requires a [SDK Business plan](https://buildwithfern.com/pricing) or above.

Merge.dev is an example of a Fern customer that uses the Snippets API to bring Python code samples [into their API Reference](https://docs.merge.dev/hris/employees/#employees_list).

## Endpoint request and response snippets
