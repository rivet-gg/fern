title: Write docs content using Markdown
description: Use Markdown and MDX to add content to your Fern documentation site, including Fern's built-in component library.
---

## Add Markdown or MDX pages

Add pages manually to your documentation by creating Markdown (`.md`) or MDX (`.mdx`) files. New to Markdown? See [Markdown Guide: Getting started](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/). 

<Note>
NOTE: Throughout our documentation, we refer to both Markdown and MDX as Markdown. [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) is a version of Markdown, extended to allow the use of JSX components.
</Note>

Place your pages inside your `fern/` folder and link to them from your [navigation settings](/learn/docs/building-your-docs/navigation) in the `docs.yml` file.

In the example below, the MDX files are inside a folder named `pages/`.

<CodeBlock title='Example folder structure'>
```bash
fern/
├─ fern.config.json
├─ docs.yml
└─ pages/
  ├─ welcome.mdx
  └─ quickstart.mdx
```
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock title='docs.yml'>
```yml
navigation:
  - section: Overview
    contents: 
      - page: Welcome 
        path: ./pages/welcome.mdx
      - page: Quickstart
        path: ./pages/quickstart.mdx
```
</CodeBlock>

## Page header

Fern automatically generates the `<h1>` page header for each page from `docs.yml`. For example, here's the `docs.yml` entry that maps the page you are reading now:
```yml
          - page: Write Markdown content
            path: ./docs/pages/fern-docs/content/write-markdown.mdx
```
The value for `page` is used as the content of the top `<h1>` element of this page. Thus, when adding content to your Markdown pages, begin with `<h2>` instead of `<h1>`.

## Fern components

Fern has a built-in component library you can use in Markdown. [Explore the components.](/learn/docs/components/overview)

## Links in Markdown

### Link target
When clicked, links to relative URLs open in the same tab, whereas links to absolute URLs open in a new browser tab. 

### Link format
Use a `/` character to begin a relative URL to another page on your docs site. This routes to the `url` defined in your `docs.yml` file, such as `example-docs.buildwithfern.com`. For example, if you want to link to `https://example-docs.buildwithfern.com/overview/introduction`, you can write the link in Markdown as follows:

<CodeBlock title='Relative link example'>
```mdx
Read the [Introduction](/learn/overview/introduction).
```
</CodeBlock>

## Images

To use images in your Markdown pages, upload them to a service such as [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/media-sharing/) or [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage).

Once you have the URL to your image, use [Markdown syntax to insert the image](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#images-1).
