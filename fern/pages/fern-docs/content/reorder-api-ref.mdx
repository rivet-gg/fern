title: Reorder your API reference
description: Reorder your API reference section and customize the structure of your documentation.

This configuration allows you to reorder sections and endpoints in the sidebar navigation menu.

## Configuration

To reorder sections, add the `layout` field to the `api` field in the `docs.yml` file. The `layout` field is an array of the sections you want to display in the order you want them to appear.

```yaml title="docs.yml"
navigation:
  - api: API Reference
    layout:
      - pet
      - store
      - user
```

To reorder endpoints, add a `:` (colon) to the end of the section name, followed by an array of the endpoints you want to display in the order you want them to appear.

```yaml title="docs.yml"
navigation:
  - api: API Reference
    layout:
      - pet:
        - addPet
        - updatePet
        - deletePet
      - store:
        - getInventory
        - placeOrder
      - user:
        - createUser
        - createUsersWithArrayInput
        - createUsersWithListInput
```
