title: Generate your API reference
description: Use Fern Docs to generate your API reference documentation from your API definition, using your choice of either OpenAPI or Fern Definition.
---

A key benefit of using Fern Docs is that once you've defined your API, you get your API Reference documentation with just one line.
Add `- api: API Reference` to your navigation in `docs.yml` and Fern takes care of the rest! You'll see your endpoints, types,
and errors automatically populated from your [OpenAPI specification](/learn/api-definition/openapi/overview) or [Fern Definition](/learn/api-definition/fern/overview).

Example:

```yml docs.yml
navigation:
  - api: API Reference
```
