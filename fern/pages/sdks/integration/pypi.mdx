title: Integrating PyPI
---

To authenticate and integrate the Python Package Index within your Python SDK, you'll need to [create an PyPI token](/learn/sdks/package-managers/pypi#creating-a-pypi-token) and [add it to your repository](/learn/sdks/package-managers/pypi#adding-tokens-to-your-github-repository). 

## Creating a PyPI token
<Steps>
### Log In
Log into [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).
### Navigate to Account Settings
Click on your profile picture and select **Account settings**.
### Create API Token
Scroll down to **API tokens** and click **Create API token**. Name your token and set the scope to the relevant projects. Once finished, click **Create token**. 
<Note title='Save your token'>
Be sure to save the generated token - it won't be displayed after you leave the page.
